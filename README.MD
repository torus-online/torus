### Redefining global digital productivity

Torus coordinates your team across the globe, secured by the blockchain -- independently managing all aspects.

You may not personally know everyone who is important to your organization, but with Torus, thereâ€™s no need to worry about fraud, theft, or international payment complications.

Torus creates smart contracts for you on the Ethereum blockchain to help you operate your digital organization. The reason Torus uses the blockchain instead of a more traditional, centralized approach is to guarantee that nobody owns any part of your organization except the real owners -- the shareholders.

## Status

Torus is currently in the earliest stages of development. We've only rolled out the smallest set of viable features to validate them before we move onto more advanced features. At this time, Torus can deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain to identify an organization and who are the owners, including the ability to transfer ownership. As soon as a publi cCardano Goguen testnet is online and the Plutus specification is stabilized, we will begin the work of migrating Torus over to Cardano. Cardano part of my original inspiration for this project, and I believe is has a more solid foundation and forward trajectory than Ethereum does.

In the future, Torus will provide more advanced decentralized organization management features, such as governance, policy creation, and treasury management.

## Newly Open-Sourced
I created Torus out of the belief that open source software efforts could be coordinated more effectively by allowing smart contracts to organize a wide net of developers across the globe. Since I believe open source is the most natural fit for this application, I decided to open-source Torus to get the community involved as early as possible to help validate its use cases and contribute to development. Anyone with skills or knowledge with blockchian, governance, or software development are invited to get involved in the discussion and/or submit PRs.
