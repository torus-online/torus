### Redefining global digital productivity

Torus coordinates your team across the globe, secured by the blockchain -- independently managing all aspects.

You may not personally know everyone who is important to your organization, but with Torus, thereâ€™s no need to worry about fraud, theft, or international payment complications.

Torus creates smart contracts for you on the Ethereum blockchain to help you operate your digital organization. The reason Torus uses the blockchain instead of a more traditional, centralized approach is to guarantee that nobody owns any part of your organization except the real owners -- the shareholders.

Torus is currently in the earliest stages of development. We've only rolled out the smallest set of viable features to validate them before we move onto more advanced features. At this time, Torus can deploy a smart contract to the blockchain to identify an organization and who are the owners, including the ability to transfer ownership.

In the future, Torus will provide more advanced decentralized organization management features, such as governance, policy creation, and treasury management.
