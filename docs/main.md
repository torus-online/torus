How do you define an org in code?
I could prototype in a language I already know

Core problem is how could one provision roles and ownership in code?

How does identity work?

Treasury is the easiest part. Most simply, define who is allowed to withdraw. Could do some really cool stuff like DLP technology.

Think about roles and partnerships. Voting rights based on ownership shares? Some logic to pass a revision.

Probably would be smart to study corporations.

Different than typical Corp. Anyone can do it without registering with any kind of authority. It exists as soon as you say it does (and set up a fund for it to continue to exist on the blockchain)

Do shareholders have direct control? Or is there a board of directors? No board sounds simpler.

Dividends.

Need to be able to appoint non-owners to roles.

Payroll. I think that's important. Being able to issue payment to individuals in roles.

Sounds like there could be legal liability issues if Corps don't register with governments.

- treasury
- owners/shareholders
  - dividends
  - voting rights
  - transfer of shares
- payroll

Best if all this stuff is code and changes to code can be voted on. 

Should code out a PoC.

What's the value prop and biz model? Trouble is that anyone can copy the code unless I put logic off the chain, which is bad. Maybe an easy UI to manage it all is the service. Include helpful insight. Dashboard.

Maybe crypto credit system is necessary to get businesses off the ground, because financing from a traditional bank is not possible without a legal entity. Legal entity seems hard to keep in sync with blockchain one.

I think I can give away shares in the beginning. That means that at least I need a system for tracking and issuing shares.

Shares could simply be 1, and could be subdivided from there.
