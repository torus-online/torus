# Voting Power

How can voting power be implemented such as it's actually useful?

1. treasury spending
    - payroll.
1. doing things.
    - this is a real tough one. Definitely upgrading the contract is a good example. Replacing the current contract w/ a new one could happen via voting.
1. roles / access to secrets ?
    - voting would be on granting roles to individuals
    - roles would grant access to secrets. I think there is trust required for secret access, and the shareholders would essentially be voting on whether they trust an individual to access a specific set of secrets
