I think we can charge for a centralized solution to making authentication easier. We would store public and private keys, and provide a number of authentication factors to automatically use the keys where necessary in Torus. 

Factors may include:
- Username/password
- Secure device (ubikey)
- One-time passwords pushes to trusted, owned accounts and devices such as email, phone number SMS, or mobile app push.
