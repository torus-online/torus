# Bootstrapping
How do we get moving?

Ultimately we can't roll out until Cardano's Gougan phase is completed and released. In the meantime, we can build the contracts on the testnet and build the GUI.

We could possibly implement in Ethereum first. I think this depends on availability of Gougan/Plutus API integration -- whether or not it can be controlled by an external web application.
