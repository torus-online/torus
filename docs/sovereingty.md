# Sovereignty

How do we make an org a thing on the blockchain? How do we guard against duplicates? How do we know which smart contract represents the real org?

Could argue that it's just code and it could be forked. I guess the question is which version is worth anything? Could be an evolutionary thing. Someone could clone and instate themselves as full owner. I suppose that if everyone from v1 prefers the CEO in v2, they could all switch and consider v2 to be authentic and worthy.

The treasury is the big thing. Can't just fork and take all. Also would deter people from just forking any old time, cause they would have to fund the whole thing.

So how does treasury owndership work? Cardano wallet that no one knows the private key to? Held by the org smart contract? Could that even work? Remember -- all authority and ownership is controlled by shares. I think it should be controlled by a vote of shareholders.

If we hold all of that as true, then we can ignore most of it until treasuries are implemented
