Secret management is hugely important. Itâ€™s a fundamental aspect of operating an organization - especially to our core mission of providing fluid ownership. For example, if an important person leaves a decentralized organization, they should immediately lose access to secrets. This is what protects the organization across borders where laws may or may not help. 

Hopefully secrets can be stored on a distributed ledger. If not, we may have to provide a centralized solution and hopefully allow for being-your-own solutions.
